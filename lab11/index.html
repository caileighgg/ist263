        <p>
            My current major at Syracuse is <strong>Graphic Design</strong> in Newhouse with a minor in information management and technology in the iSchool, combining my passion for both communications and design. 
        <p>
        <p>
            I am a <strong>coxswain</strong> on the Division 1 rowing team here. I dedicate 20+ hours to the team per week. Additionally, I have been an elected member of the <strong>leadership council</strong> on the team since my first year by my teammates. I have been a Dean's List recipient all three semesters I have been studying at Syracuse, as well.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Outside of school and athletics, what I do most is spend time with my family. My mom is an outstanding cook, so food is something that has always brought us together. Consequenetly my family love for food has made me a big “foody.” My favorite thing is trying new foods and restaurants and being able to cooking for myself and friends.</p>

            <p> My favorite TV shows are: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Yellowstone on Peacock</li> <li>Normal People on Hulu</li> <li> Stranger Things on Netflic</li>
                </ol> 

                <p>I watch a lot of movies and TV shows so my favorites switch often.
                My favorite artists to listen to are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Taylor Swift</li> <li>Vampire Weekend</li> <li>Bon Iver</li>
                </ol> 
                <p>I am also very creative and spend a lot of my time creating things for my apartment, and to give as presents to a lot of people.</p>
