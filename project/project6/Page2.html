    <h2>Calls for shove and landing</h2>
    <h3>Calling a boat off rack and into the water:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>“Hands on”</li>
        <li>“Up an inch and off…ready up” (relative to where the specific boat is being stored)</li>
        <li>“Up to shoulders…ready up” </li>
        <li>“Walk it out” (watching the riggers)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Crew is now on dock (bow always pointed in the direction you will be going)*remember which direction you came out (bow or stern first) because that is a coxswains responsibility to put it back on the rack correctly*
    </p>
    <h3>Calling it into the water:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>“Up over heads, ready up”</li>
        <li>"Roll down to waist, ready down”</li>
        <li>“In the water together, ready down”</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Calling the shove:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>“Count down from bow seat when ready”</li>
        <li>“One hand on the dock”</li>
        <li>“Shove off in two, ready one, two, shove”</li>

        <li>"Up to waist ready up" </li>
        <li>"Up over heads ready up" </li>
        <li>"Split to shoulder ready split" </li>
        <li>"Walk it in" </li>
        <li>Up to coxswain's discretion where the boat will go back on the rack…important to remember how it came out in the beginning of practice! </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Informational Calls</h2>
    <h3>Things to have control over:</h3>
    <h4>The Splits (the amount of time a 500m takes) (speed per 500m)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>“We are at ____, (split #) let's find one more split by pressing the legs down”
        </li>
        <li>“We are at ___, (split #) this is feeling solid.” 
        </li>
        <li>“We are going ____, (split #) when we shift it will be ___.”
        </li>
        <li>“If we want to win we need a ___ (split #) right now.”</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>The Rate (strokes per minute) (spm)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The rate is a great tool.</li>
        <li>It is how fast the rowers are moving per minute.</li>
        <li>The lower the rate the slower they will be moving.</li>
        <li>The higher the rate the faster they will be moving. (Fast rate is unsustainable for long periods of time.)</li>
        <li>Be communicative about the rate the rowers are going at.</li>
        <li>Usually you will work with a coach on what rate is needed. EXECUTE it to the tee. </li>
        <li>Be informational about what rate they ARE at and what rate they NEED to be at. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Distance & Location</h3>
    <h4>Distance</h4>
    <p>Distance refers to the meters (m) The rowers do not know how far they have gone or how far they need to go. This is how you tell them. Distance (meters) are important in how the race, pieces, steady is split up so don't be shy on giving the rowers this information </p>

    <h4>Location</h4>
    <p>Location refers to where your boat is compared to the competition and to landmarks. Landmarks typically are only used when the rowers are familiar with the course they are racing on or practicing on. It gives them an indication on where they are which can be motivational. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>“We are two seats up”</li>
        <li>“We are a length down”</li>
        <li>"We are one seat down, I need to you give me a seat”</li>
        <li>"We are about to come up on _____ (given landmark) where we will take our move."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical</h3>
    <p>These calls come with time because the boat feel comes with time!
        When you understand the rowing stroke, you can make the best technical calls
        Technical calls tend to be reminders or corrections to find boat speed.</p>
    <h4>The parts of the stroke you need to know in order to make technical calls:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The catch</li>
        <li>The drive</li>
        <li>The Finish</li>
        <li>The recovery </li>
    </ol>
    <p>he key to technical calls is listening to what the coach is saying 
        Don't be ashamed in repeating what the coach is saying to your rowers/athletes
        This will only be effective if you understand it yourself so you can use the best words
        Ask coaches questions…ask them what they mean…ask them to demonstrate
    </p>

    <p>
        Be demanding <br> 
        Be informational <br> 
        Be communicative <br> 
        Be yourself. <br> 
    </p>

    <h3>Spare parts</h3>
    <p>If you are coxing an American boat (vespoli, pocock, resolute) then you need 7/16 spare parts. If you are coxing in an international boat (empacher) then you need 10m spare parts. <br> Know which parts are used in the boat you are using. Carry around spare parts. It is not uncommon for parts to come loose or fall off while on the water. <br> Be prepared and predictable.</p>
